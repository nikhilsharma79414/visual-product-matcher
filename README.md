# 🖼️ Visual Product Matcher

A simple and mobile-friendly web app that allows users to upload an image (or enter an image URL) and preview it instantly.  
It simulates finding visually similar products — the foundation for a visual search system.

## 🚀 Features
- 📤 Upload image from your device  
- 🌐 Paste an image URL  
- 👀 View uploaded image preview  
- 🔍 “Find Similar Products” button with a simulated loading animation  
- 💻 Responsive design for both mobile and desktop

## 🧠 How It Works
This version uses pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no backend or AI model yet.  
When you upload an image, it is displayed on-screen, and clicking “Find Similar Products” triggers a simulated search.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Integrate a backend with image feature extraction (CNN or CLIP)

- Add product filtering and similarity scores
